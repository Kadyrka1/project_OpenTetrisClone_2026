# project_OpenTetrisClone_2026

Description:
This project is a standalone arcade implementation of the classic Tetris game, developed for learning and hardware integration purposes.

The game is designed to run on a physical LED matrix display composed of a 10 × 20 LED strip arrangement, replicating the traditional Tetris board dimensions. The goal is to create a fully functional arcade-style system using programmable LED strips as the visual output.

Developed in Creapolis, Coburg, Germany (2026).

This project is intended strictly for educational and experimental purposes.
