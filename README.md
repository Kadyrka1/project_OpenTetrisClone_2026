# 🎮 Tetris Arcade – LED Matrix Implementation

A standalone hardware-based implementation of the classic Tetris game, designed and developed as an educational embedded systems project.

This project recreates the traditional 10 × 20 Tetris board using a physical LED strip matrix and is intended to function as a complete arcade-style system.

Developed in 2026 at Creapolis, Coburg, Germany.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on combining software game logic with hardware control systems.
The goal is to build a fully functional Tetris arcade system using programmable LED strips arranged into a 10 × 20 matrix display.

The system is designed to:

* Replicate classic Tetris gameplay mechanics
* Control a physical LED matrix in real time
* Operate as a standalone arcade unit
* Serve as a learning platform for embedded programming and hardware integration

This is a non-commercial educational recreation of the original Tetris concept.

## 🏗 System Architecture
**Core Components:**

* ESP32 D1 R32 - ESP32 DEV MODULE 
* 10 × 10 LED strip matrix (100 individually addressable LEDs, WS2813)
* HD44780 2004 LCD display 4x20 characters blue
* Button
* Joystick 


The architecture separates:

* Game state logic
* Rendering logic
* Hardware abstraction

This allows easier testing, debugging, and future scalability.
